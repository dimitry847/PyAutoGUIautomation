About
A Python Project to Automate Web Browser Activity, using PyAutoGUI Library

This is my humble trial to Automate Firefox Browser - Changing Proxy, Opening New Tab, Going to Google to check IP, that is assigned to my Browser Instance.

Here you have to notice that I am using - PyAutoGUI library, which is an unique way to automate my locating a particular image from the pre-recorded time, to figureout current automation step.

Whatever images that I have supplied here will not work directly for anybody else, but you can try by building up your own imageset and then replacing them on appropriate locations.

What you might need and how to run the script

1] You must have pyautogui installed
2] Firefox
3] Replace the image with your own code
4] Run the script
	python webautomation.py
