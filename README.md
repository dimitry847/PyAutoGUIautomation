# PyAutoGUIautomation
A Python Project to Automate Web Browser Activity, using PyAutoGUI Library

This is my humble trial to Automate Firefox Browser - Changing Proxy, Opening New Tab, Going to Google to check IP, that is assigned to my Browser Instance.

Here you have to notice that I am using - PyAutoGUI library, which is an unique way to automate my locating a particular image from the pre-recorded time, to figureout current automation step.

Whatever images that I have supplied here will not work directly for anybody else, but you can try by building up your own imageset and then replacing them on appropriate locations.
